# PROMPTED

### [Demo](http://mkaminsky11.github.io/prompted)
### [Documentation](https://github.com/mkaminsky11/prompted/wiki)

A Linux terminal emulator written in vanilla Javascript

```javascript
var terminal = new prompted(document.getElementById("main"));
```

## Capabilities
### What it can do
+ evaluate commands
+ simulate a basic file structure
+ give some errors
+ basic autocomplete

### What it can't do(yet)
+ pipe
+ exactly replicate a Linux terminal

It's written in Javascript, so just calm down. It's not perfect.
